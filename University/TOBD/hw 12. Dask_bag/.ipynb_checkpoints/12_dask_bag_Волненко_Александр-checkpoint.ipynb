       "    'review': 'such a simple recipe my bf was impressed theyre vegan i love these theyre so fluffy and creamy o i used alpro coconut milk and only tbsp of baking powder and tbsp of mollas sugar i still found these a lil saltybitter i think its the baking powder as everyone has suggested the first time i used tbsp which was even worse  i might use tbsp next time or maybe i didnt add enough sugar this is a good basic recipe to tweak but following the recipe  wont get you the best pancakes hence why i gave  they taste good with peanut butter smeared on them to hide the saltiness though i also added in tsp of cinnamon and  tsp of vanilla essence i had some plain and with toppings i made  small ones and ate half at home for breakfast this morning and the other half at work as a snack theyre delicious a lovely moist spongey texture ',\n",

       "    'review': 'i am not sure if the rest of you have made gazes before especially for cinnamon rollsbut this recipe was terrible  the butter added a darker color than preferred and the consistency was grittyi know how to cook bake and follow recipes but i had to try this more than once after reading the reviews  however both times i did not like the darker color due to the butter and the grittiness even with the softestmost sifted powdered sugar  in addition either wit oj or milk or both or adding it graduallydrizzling it init just did not matter  it was thick and did not harden as cooled by the way removing the butter really helped a lot  you can also use cream cheese instead of butter or eliminate it all togetheralso you can replace the oj andor milk with just water  so basically you end up with an easier recipe of powdered sugar vanilla and water or milkmuch much better  nice and clearish white glaze perfectly drizzible consistency and does harden as it coolswhen warmed back up it melts perfectly again just like the original application  do not attempt this recipe it is a waste of time and butter lol',\n",

       "    'review': 'i had actually never heard of this roast before and saw it at my local grocers meat department meat counter  when i saw it the color was the most beautiful red i had to purchase it  when i got home i did a search for the meat and found this recipe  when i made it i did get alittle scared frying it in the olive oil but it was so worth it  this meat tasted like a steak from the finest resturant  i did research in this meat and found that it is known to be tough but it was the total opposite  one tip i would like to share is to cook to rarest temp take out then cook to desired tempature in microwave  that way whenever you decide to have the leftovers if there are any you can take it from the fridge to the microwave and cook it to desired tempature without it being tough or overcooked  in short definitly a five star recipe',\n",

       "    'review': 'to be honest i have never tried to make a low carb dessert so i did not know what to expect i was feigning for chocolate all day and about to break my diet stage  atkins desperate ltbrgtin other words i made this just like it said and it did not rise but it smelled really good while cooking upon completion it was very greasy butter i guess  and looked more like a thin cookie after being cut in squares they crumble easy unless you let it cool well taste hmmm taste well at first i thought it was kind of gritty but chocolaty and tasted good but was a bit as my husband said like eating a ant hill  lol  however what i did was spread whipped cream cheese all over the tops of each square and suddenly they were delicious almost like a chocolate oreo pie crust spread with cream cheese all of the feigning was gone i was cured i would make it again after all it is difficult to expect a miracle when your on such a low carb diet they are sugar free and flour free no they do not compare to a real brownie but it will cut the  craving right out after i fed it to my husband with the cream cheese he said it was pretty good that means quotokquot in picky peoples terms',\n",

       "    'review': 'i did the recipe as written my problem was how to cut the meat i found out after the fact how to scallop the meat but still never understood it so i just landed up slicing it at at angle into strips but the meat did turn out a little chewy so perhaps i cut it the wrong way for those that want to know how to cut scalloped i will attach at the bottom of this review maybe sharon can add it to this recipe somehow  i did not find it taking as long to cook for all the steps it was about a  minute cooking time total personally i found the cumin flavor was just way too much i would definitely cut this spice back because it overwhelmed all the other flavors otherwise the flavor of the sauce was good and there was plenty to have to soak up noodles or rice whichever you serve with it i chose to use rice this dish serves about  people and that is with a rice or noodles as a side dish with it thanks sharon for sharing this recipe made in honor of your dh brto scallop meatbrstart with the meat in front of you on a firm surface with the grain running from left to right  with a sharp heavy knife held almost parallel to the surface slide the knife through the meat about  inch below the surface at about a  angle to the grain and cut off a piece that measures about  by  inches  make the second cut right next to the first one also about  from the grain but in the opposite direction  continue removing thin ovals down the length of the meat then through the thickness  dont hurry and try to keep the scallops as nearly the same size as possible so theyll cook in about the same amount of time',\n",

crackers once amp discovered that the cracker crumb biscuit topping served the important purpose of keeping the tops from over cooking by the time the filling had gotten hot enough to fully cook the

protects the tops of the biscuits from over cooking but they also collect in the spaces between the biscuits amp are in themselves also a yummy casserole topping in addition to the biscuits ive never added diced potatoes to my filling yet but ifwhen i did i would cook them in the stock while reducing it down with the bones before adding the potatoes into the filling mixtureltbrgtltbrgtany version of this casserole is basically just an easy homemade chicken pot pie with a bisquit topping instead of a pie crust as such it is easily adapted to your own preferences as far as how saucy you make it whether you use canned soups in your filling or exclusively use a made from scratch chicken sauce and what veggies you use if any ltbrgtltbrgtthe key to making sure the bisquits are not doughy on the bottom is to ensure that the filling gets hot enough during the baking time to fully cook them not on how thick or saucy the filling is my process is to use some hot stock in my saucier filling and to preheat my combined filling mixture in the microwave prior to assembling the casserole with the biscuits in the baking dish this version achieves the same idea by parbaking the filling in the baking dish then removing from the oven adding the biscuits amp then putting it back into the oven ltbrgtltbrgtthe first time my sister amp i made the chicken num num casserole we were kinda grossed out at

       "   'review': 'first off i have to admit that i have written this review a couple times already and admittedly i was so angry i couldnt write it properly  so after trying to settle down a bit here goesltbrgtltbrgta  the recipe is very poorly written  i have provided many recipes over the years to family friends and as contributions to charityfundraiser cookbooks  i write recipes in painstaking detailnothing unnecessaryso that the cook who is using my recipe doesnt have to guess about what they need to do  everything must be spelled out preciselyltbrgtltbrgtb  when i am following a recipe i prepare all the ingredients as listed and described completely so when its time to use them im not scurrying around for somethingltbrgti  direction number two is quotfry the onion till golden in a couple of tablespoons of lightly browned butter  the recipe calls for  tbsp of butter  direction number  is quotfry them slowly in plenty of butterquot  what is plenty of butter  this needs to be more specific  when cooks have prepared something many times they progress beyond needing specific amounts often because they have personalized the recipe and its their own  but this and every published recipe must be done as though the chef is making the recipe for the first time  because this was my first  time as i said i followed the directions exactlyltbrgtii  based on the list of ingredients i made sure i had soy sauce on hand  admittedly the recipe called for  teaspoon of soy sauce  really  in a pound of meat  teaspoon of soy sauce but wait  after making sure you have the soy sauce it is never mentioned again  where are we to put the soy sauce  in the meat  in the cream sauceltbrgtiii  the ingredients call for quot cup cream half and half or  cup milk  im sorry but this is unintelligible  should we use cream or half and half or milk  why is quothalf and halfquot in brackets  cream is cream  half and half is half and half and milk is milk  decide and then tell us what to do  if we want to change it to accommodate a particular lifestyle we will change it but please be clear about what the cook is supposed to useie tell us what the standard of quotexcellencequot is for this recipe  what in your mind makes it bestltbrgtltbrgtc  after assembling the called for ingredients and absolutely omitting the water because by the time all the other ingredients were assembled it was raw soup not able to be formed into meatballs i could not begin to move forward with shaping them into ballsltbrgtltbrgtd  i suggest the following which i did in an effort to save the  i spent on meat and ingredients i didnt have on hand  again if you want to make changes to make it your own ok but i can only tell you what worked for meltbrgti  use cream not  half and half and not milk  use  cupltbrgtii completely omit the waterltbrgtiiibased on this recipe use at least c dried breadcrumbs and more if necessaryltbrgt        iv add some flavor to the meat  there is nothing but allspice and that according to the ltbrgtquotsourcequot is optional  i dont know about you but i think meatballs are basically miniround meatloaves  i do not make a meatloaf devoid of seasoning  why would i make a meatball devoid of seasoning  yes i know that people rave about the sauce but i have learned this in my years of cooking  if the meat itself is not seasoned and only depends on the sauce its in for flavor what you get is a mouthful of unflavored meat with some sauce on it  i learned this the hard way with quotthe best chili you will ever tastequot when i thought the chili was magnificent until i tasted the meat and it was like having a mouthful of flavorlesssomething  meat needs to be able to stand on its own and then be enhanced by a saucethe sauce cannot make up for flavorless meat  i dont know what ikea meatballs are likeperhaps they are supposed to be bland and let the sauce do the workpersonally i added  two teaspoons of cumin two teaspoons of ground coriander two teaspoons of ground fennel and cloves of garlic to go along with the onionltbrgtv  chill the meatball mixture for  hours  more is ok less is not a good idealtbrgtvi  dont just cook the meatballs slowly in plenty of butter  use two tablespoons of butter clarified if possible and two tablespoons of olive oil  because you are cooking slowly so as to make sure the meatball is cooked through without the outside being ruined you can use olive oil despite it relatively low smoking point  it will be okbut cook on medium heat at best  im not being specific here because there are so many permutations of rangesi use a viking stovetop and have complete controlso anything wrong is my faultto lower and raise temp immediately  ltbrgtltbrgti have now based on the original recipe and only adding extra breadcrumbs and omitting the watertried frying these little clumps  they are flavorless by themselves and beg for the seasonings i mentioned above  the texture is wonderful but the meatballs remain flavorlessltbrgtheres a great chance for you to season to your hearts contentor notits up to you how you want your meatballs to tasteltbrgtltbrgtanyway im sorry that this didnt turn out the way it should  thank you dee for giving us a great starting point to make some incredo meatballs  i suggest making changes which will make these little morsels quite tasty  i cant comment on the cream sauce yet',\n",
