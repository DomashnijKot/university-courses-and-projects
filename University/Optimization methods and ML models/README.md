2. One dimensional optimization(minimization) methods implementation and visualization.
3. Gradients optimization(minimization) methods and visualization implementation. 
4. Regression(Linear, Polynomial, Exponential) models and visualization implementation with StochasticGradientDescent/NormalEquation solvers.
5. Optimization with equality/inequality constraints. Interior point methods and visualization implementation.
6. Classification. Implementation of LogisticRegression(Ridge, Lasso), LogisticRegression with RBF kernel function, SVMs classifiers.
7. Integer linear programming. Implementation of Tabular Simplex method and Gomori cutting plane method for integer linear programming.
8. Stochastic optimization. Implementation of Stochastic gradient descent, Support vector classifier on 2 classes optimized by SGD, simulated annealing algorithm for function minimization, genetic algorithm for function minimization. Built in visualization implemented.
